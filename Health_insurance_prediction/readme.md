Problem Statement: Predicting Health Insurance Costs and Building a GUI Predictor

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model using linear regression to estimate health insurance costs for individuals based on various factors. The dataset used for this analysis contains information about individuals, including their age, sex, BMI (Body Mass Index), number of children, smoking habits, and region.

The goals of this project are as follows:

Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the insurance dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables appropriately.

Feature Selection: Identify the relevant features that significantly affect health insurance costs. Perform any necessary feature engineering or transformation.

Model Development: Split the dataset into training and test sets. Develop a linear regression model and train it using the training data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model by predicting the health insurance costs on the test set. Calculate the root mean squared error (RMSE) as a measure of prediction accuracy.

Model Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, we aim to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) predictor. The GUI will provide a user-friendly interface where users can input their information such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region. The model will then use these inputs to predict the health insurance costs for the user.

GUI Design and Development: Design and develop the GUI using a suitable framework or library, such as Tkinter, PyQt, or Dash. Ensure that the GUI is intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing. Implement the necessary functionality to accept user inputs, pass them to the trained model, and display the predicted health insurance costs.

Model Interpretation: Analyze the coefficients of the linear regression model to determine the impact of each feature on the predicted health insurance costs. Identify the most influential factors affecting insurance costs and provide insights based on the model's findings.

By completing this project, we aim to develop an accurate predictive model for health insurance costs and create a user-friendly GUI predictor. This GUI will allow users to obtain personalized cost estimates based on their individual information, enabling better financial planning and decision-making related to health insurance coverage.
